information about themselves in their normal use of the Tiwun. This
could occur through use of the optional profile fields, classifieds or
comments. Information like that, which is voluntarily posted in publicly
visible parts of the Tiwun, is considered to be public, even if it
would otherwise be considered to be personally identifying or sensitive.
As such, it is not subject to the protocols listed below, because we
don’t control it; you do. Additionally, voluntarily publicizing such
information means that you lose any privacy rights you might normally
have with regards to that information. It also increases your chances of
receiving unwanted communications, like spam.</p><h4 id="information-you-give-to-other-people">Information You Give to Other People</h4><p>This Policy only applies to information collected by Tiwun. It

third party websites, and any information you provide to those sites will
be covered by any privacy policies they may have. Please be sure to read
the privacy policies of any third-party sites you visit. It is those
sites' responsibility to protect any information you give them, so we
can't be held liable for their wrongful use of your personally
identifying information.</p><h4 id="do-we-use-cookies">Do we use cookies?</h4><p>Yes (Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider
